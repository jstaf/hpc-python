	<h1>Snakefiles</h1>
	
	

<p>Create a file, called <code>Snakefile</code>, with the following content:</p>

<pre><code># Count words.
rule count_words:
    input: 'books/isles.txt',
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'
</code></pre>

<p>This is a build file, which for
Snakemake is called a Snakefile - a file executed
by Snakemake. Note that aside from a few keyword additions like <code>rule</code>,
it follows standard Python 3 syntax.</p>

<p>Let us go through each line in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#</code> denotes a <em>comment</em>. Any text from <code>#</code> to the end of the line is
ignored by Make.</li>
<li><code>isles.dat</code> is a target, a file to be
created, or built. In Snakemake, these are called &ldquo;outputs&rdquo;, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake.</li>
<li><code>books/isles.txt</code> is a dependency, a
file that is needed to build or update the target. Targets can have
zero or more dependencies. Dependencies in Snakemake are called &ldquo;inputs&rdquo;.</li>
<li><code>python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat</code> is an
action, a command to run to build or update
the target using the dependencies. In this case the action is a set of
shell commands (we can also use python code&hellip; more on that later).</li>
<li>Like python, you can use either tabs or spaces for indentation (don&rsquo;t use both!).</li>
<li>Together, the target, dependencies, and actions form a
a rule. A rule is a recipe for how to make things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our rule above describes how to build the target <code>isles.dat</code> using the
action <code>python wordcount.py</code> and the dependency <code>books/isles.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Information that was implicit in our shell script - that we are
generating a file called <code>isles.dat</code> and that creating this file
requires <code>books/isles.txt</code> - is now made explicit by Snakemake&rsquo;s syntax.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first ensure we start from scratch and delete the <code>.dat</code> and <code>.png</code>
files we created earlier:</p>

<pre><code>rm *.dat *.png
</code></pre>

<p>By default, Snakemake looks for a file called <code>Snakefile</code>, and we can
run Snakemake as follows:</p>

<pre><code>snakemake
</code></pre>

<p>By default, Snakemake tells us what it&rsquo;s doing as it executes actions:</p>

<pre><code>Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
</code></pre>

<p>If we see an error, check your syntax.
Remember, aside from stuff like <code>rule</code> and <code>input</code>,
Snakemake follows Python syntax.
Let&rsquo;s see if we got what we expected:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 isles.dat
</code></pre>

<p>The first 5 lines of <code>isles.dat</code> should look exactly like before.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Snakefiles Do Not Have to be Called Snakefile</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to call our Snakefile <code>Snakefile</code>. However, if we call it
something else we need to tell Make where to find it. This we can do
using <code>-s</code> flag. For example, if our Makefile is named <code>MyOtherSnakefile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>snakemake -s MyOtherMakefile
</code></pre>
</p>
</div>

<p>When we re-run our Snakefile, Snakemake now informs us that:</p>

<pre><code>Nothing to be done.
</code></pre>

<p>This is because our target, <code>isles.dat</code>, has now been created, and
Snakemake will not create it again. To see how this works, let&rsquo;s pretend to
update one of the text files. Rather than opening the file in an
editor, we can use the shell <code>touch</code> command to update its timestamp
(which would happen if we did edit the file):</p>

<pre><code>touch books/isles.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If we compare the timestamps of <code>books/isles.txt</code> and <code>isles.dat</code>,</p>

<pre><code>ls -l books/isles.txt isles.dat
</code></pre>

<p>then we see that <code>isles.dat</code>, the target, is now older
than<code>books/isles.txt</code>, its dependency:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   323972 Jun 12 10:35 books/isles.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   182273 Jun 12 09:58 isles.dat
</code></pre>

<p>If we run Make again,</p>

<pre><code>snakemake
</code></pre>

<p>then it recreates <code>isles.dat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
</code></pre>

<p>When it is asked to build a target, Snakemake checks the &lsquo;last modification
time&rsquo; of both the target and its dependencies. If any dependency has
been updated since the target, then the actions are re-run to update
the target. Using this approach, Snakemake knows to only rebuild the files
that, either directly or indirectly, depend on the file that
changed. This is called an incremental build.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Snakefiles as Documentation</p>
<p>By explicitly recording the inputs to and outputs from steps in our
analysis and the dependencies between files, Snakefiles act as a type
of documentation, reducing the number of things we have to remember.</p>
</div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add another rule to the end of <code>Snakefile</code>.
Note that rules cannot have the same name,
so we&rsquo;ll call this one <code>count_words_abyss</code>.</p>

<pre><code>rule count_words_abyss:
	input: 	'books/abyss.txt'
	output: 'abyss.dat'
	shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
</code></pre>

<p>If we run Snakemake,</p>

<pre><code>snakemake
</code></pre>

<p>then we get:</p>

<pre><code>Nothing to be done.
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing happens because Snakemake attempts to build the first target it
finds in the Snakefile, the default target,
which is <code>isles.dat</code> which is
already up-to-date. We need to explicitly tell Make we want to build
<code>abyss.dat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>snakemake abyss.dat
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we get:</p>

<pre><code>Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words_abyss
        1

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) doneat
</code></pre>

<div class="admonition ">
<p class="first admonition-title">Nothing to be done vs. MissingRuleException</p>
<p>If we ask Snakemake to build a file that already exists and is up to
date, then Snakemake informs us that:</p>

<pre><code>Nothing to be done
</code></pre>

<p>If we ask Snakemake to build a file that exists but for which there is
no rule in our Snakefile, then we get message like:</p>

<pre><code>snakemake wordcount.py
</code></pre>

<pre><code>MissingRuleException:
No rule to produce wordcount.py (if you use input functions make sure that they don't raise unexpected exceptions).
</code></pre>

<p>When we see this error, double-check that you have a rule to produce that file, and also that the filename has been specified correctly.
Even a small difference in a filename will result in a MissingRuleException.</p>
</div>

<p>We may want to remove all our data files so we can explicitly recreate
them all. We can introduce a new target, and associated rule, to do
this. We will call it <code>clean</code>, as this is a common name for rules that
delete auto-generated files, like our <code>.dat</code> files:</p>

<pre><code>rule clean:
    shell: 'rm -f *.dat'
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of a rule that has no inputs or outputs!. We just want to remove the data files whether or
not they exist. If we run Make and specify this target,</p>

<pre><code>snakemake clean
</code></pre>

<p>then we get:</p>

<pre><code>Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       clean
        1

rule clean:
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
</code></pre>

<p>An <code>ls</code> of our current directory reveals that all of our troublesome output files are now gone (as planned)!</p>

<p>We can add a similar command to create all the data files. We can put
this at the top of our Snakefile so that it is the <a href="{{ page.root }}/reference/#default-target">default
target</a>, which is executed by default
if no target is given to the <code>snakemake</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>rule dats:
     input:
         'isles.dat',
         'abyss.dat'
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of a rule that has dependencies that are targets of
other rules. When Make runs, it will check to see if the dependencies
exist and, if not, will see if rules are available that will create
these. If such rules exist it will invoke these first, otherwise
Make will raise an error.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Dependencies</p>
<p>The order of rebuilding dependencies is arbitrary. You should not
assume that they will be built in the order in which they are
listed.</p>

<p>Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. A target cannot
depend on a dependency which itself, or one of its dependencies,
depends on that target.</p>
</div>

<p>This rule is also an example of a rule that has no actions. It is used
purely to trigger the build of its dependencies, if needed.</p>

<p>If we run,</p>

<pre><code>snakemake dats
</code></pre>

<p>then snakemake creates the data files:</p>

<pre><code>Provided cores: 1

        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1       count_words_abyss
        1       dats
        3

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 1

localrule dats:
    input: isles.dat, abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
3 of 3 steps (100%) done
</code></pre>

<p>If we run <code>dats</code> again, then snakemake will see that the dependencies (isles.dat
and abyss.dat) are already up to date.
Given the target <code>dats</code> has no actions, there is <code>nothing to be done</code>:</p>

<pre><code>snakemake dats
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Nothing to be done
</code></pre>

<p>Our Snakefile now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>rule dats:
     input:
         'isles.dat',
         'abyss.dat'


# delete everything so we can re-run things
rule clean:
    shell:  'rm -f *.dat'


# count words in one of our &quot;books&quot;
rule count_words:
    input: 	'books/isles.txt'
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'


rule count_words_abyss:
    input: 	'books/abyss.txt'
    output: 'abyss.dat'
    shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
</code></pre>

<p>The following figure shows a graph of the dependencies embodied within
our Snakefile, involved in building the <code>dats</code> target:</p>

<p><img src="../02-dats-dag.svg" alt="Dependencies represented within the Snakefile" /></p>

<p>At this point, it becomes important to see what snakemake is doing behind the scenes.
What commands is snakemake actually running?
Snakemake has a special option (<code>-p</code>), that prints every command it is about to run.
Additionally, we can also perform a dry run with <code>-n</code>.
A dry run does nothing, and simply prints out commands instead of actually executing them.
Very useful for debugging!</p>

<pre><code>snakemake clean
snakemake -n -p isles.dat
</code></pre>

<pre><code>rule count_words:
    input: wordcount.py, books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: file=isles

python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat

	count	jobs
	1	count_words
	1

<div class="admonition ">
