Python is probably the most versatile language in existence.
However one of its most useful features is its ability to tie things 
together and automate the execution of other programs.

This tutorial focuses on using Python in HPC environments to automate 
data analysis pipelines.
We'll start with the basics and cover everything you need to get started 
writing pipelines.
Some elements of writing performance-oriented code will be covered,
but it is not the main focus.
There is no prerequisite knowlege for this tutorial.

## Setup

You will want to have Python 3 and your favorite Python IDE preinstalled
and ready to go.
If you don't know where to get things or what to install, 
just install Anaconda (the Python 3 version) from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
Anaconda is an extremely comprehensive Python distribution that comes 
with all of the bells and whistles ready to go.
